# COP5522 Class Project Report

I wrote the proposal using LaTeX and then converted that format to PDF. The PDF in this folder is what will be submitted to the professor.

# LaTeX Editor

In order to edit the LaTeX file, you will need a LaTeX editor and distribution. MiKTeX is a popular editor and distribution for Windows. Instructions are [here](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex).

# Editing the LaTex File

After installing MiKTeX, you should be able to open the file in the MiKTeX editor by double-clicking the `COP5520-project-proposal.tex` file in Windows Explorer.
